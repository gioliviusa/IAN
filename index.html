            <h2>About IAN</h2>
            <p>The 2008 Financial Crisis led people to start doubting the fiat monetary system, as speculation grew towards its trustworthiness. This climate was when Bitcoin's creator Satoshi Nakamoto lit his fuse by making it possible for users of this new peer-to-peer payment network that did not require going through traditional financial channels like banks or credit card companies to trade freely without any intermediaries getting involved in between them.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <div class="links-grid">
                <div class="link-card">
                    <h3>Private internet</h3>
                    <p>A Ethereum app doesn't require your personal information. A crypto-economy on Ethereum is based on value, not surveillance.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="link-card">
                    <h3>Banking for everyone</h3>
                    <p>Financial services aren't accessible to everyone. A good internet connection is all you need to access Ethereum and its lending, borrowing, and savings products.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="link-card">
                    <h3>A peer-to-peer network</h3>
                    <p>Ethereum allows you to move money, or make agreements, directly with someone else. You don't need to go through intermediary companies.</p>

                    <h3>Censorship-resistant</h3>
                    <p>Ethereum is not controlled by any government or company. This decentralization makes it nearly impossible for anyone to stop you from receiving payments or using services on Ethereum.</p>

            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>Ian has launched a new project that will provide an easy and accessible way to use cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency ecosystem of Ethereum (ETH) and Binance smart chain (BNB) is available to anyone with access to a computer or cell phone, which means it's really easy for people in developing countries or those without bank accounts or credit cards to use this system. Ian was created so that all people have equal access to financial services and data-friendly technology. It's also designed as a community-built solution with thousands of apps already built on top of its platform. This allows users from around the world who speak different languages and have varying levels of technical knowledge about how computers work.</p>
            
            <p>Ian brings Ethereum Mixer services to the masses, making it easy and safe for people to use their money anywhere in the world without worrying about theft or other forms of corruption. Ian is built around a set of core values that were created by people from all over the world with different backgrounds and experiences who joined forces with one big goal.</p>

        <section id="token-system">
            <h2>Token System</h2>
            <p>The key point to understand is that a currency, or token system, is a database with one operation: subtract X units from A and give X units to B, with the provision that (1) A had at least X units before the transaction and (2) the transaction is approved by A. All that it takes to implement a token system is to implement this logic into a contract. An alternative to the present financial system that is global and open. You can use this collection of products to borrow, save, invest, trade, and more. There are no licensing fees for this technology, so anybody can use it.</p>

            <h2>Blockchain Technology</h2>
            <p>A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked together using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was published in order to get into its hash. As blocks each contain information about the block previous to it, they form a chain, with each additional block reinforcing the ones before it. Therefore, blockchains are resistant to modification of their data because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.</p>

            <h2>Why Stake IAN?</h2>
            <p>When I stake, I am in a position where after ending my stake period, not only will the contract return to me the IAN that I put in, but as well, the contract will return additional IAN based on an interest rate and any bonus payouts included in the contract.</p>
            
            <p>Smart contracts allow you to commit your IAN ETH and any other ERC20 for a predetermined period of time by using the IAN Staking function. As of right now, the time frame is one day. For instance, I might choose to stake 10,000 IAN for 10 days. The IAN will not be available during this period, but at the end of 10 days I will end my stake and receive my 10,000 + reward.</p>
